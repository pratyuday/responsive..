         The Indian Army is the land-based branch and largest component of the
        Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander 
        of the Indian Army, and its professional head is the Chief of Army
        Staff (COAS). The Indian Army was established on 1 April 1895 alongside
        the long established presidency armies of the East India Company, 
        which too were absorbed into it in 1903. Some princely states
        maintained their own armies which formed the Imperial Service Troops 
        which, along with the Indian Army formed the land component of 
        the Armed Forces of the Crown of India, responsible for the defence
        of the Indian Empire. The Imperial Service Troops were merged
        into the Indian Army after independence. The units and regiments of
        the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in several 
        battles and campaigns around the world, earning many battle and theatre
        honours before and after Independence.</p>
